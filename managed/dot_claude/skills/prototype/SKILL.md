# Prototype

A prototype is **throwaway code that answers a question**. The question decides the shape.

## Pick a branch

Identify which question is being answered — from the user's prompt, the surrounding code, or by asking if the user is around:

- **"Does this logic / state model feel right?"** → [LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md). Build a single shareable HTML file — free-play buttons plus tabbed guided walkthroughs — that pushes the state machine through cases that are hard to reason about on paper, and that a non-developer can drive.
- **"What should this look like?"** → [UI.md](UI.md). Generate several radically different UI variations on a single route, switchable via a URL search param and a floating bottom bar.

The two branches produce very different artifacts — getting this wrong wastes the whole prototype. If the question is genuinely ambiguous and the user isn't reachable, default to whichever branch better matches the surrounding code (a backend module → logic; a page or component → UI) and state the assumption at the top of the prototype.

## Rules that apply to both

1. **Throwaway from day one, and clearly marked as such.** A self-contained logic demo is a single HTML file and belongs in the workbook — `~/Documents/Workbook/01-09 Capture & Scratch/01.07 Agent Scratch/<repo>/prototypes/<name>/`, where `<repo>` is `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`. A UI prototype has to run inside the app, so it lives next to the page it's prototyping for, obeying whatever routing convention the project already uses — but name it so a casual reader can see it's a prototype, not production, and leave it **uncommitted** in the working tree.
2. **Trivial to run.** A UI prototype starts from one command in the project's task runner — `pnpm <name>`, `python <path>`, `bun <path>`, etc. A logic demo is a single HTML file the user double-clicks. Either way, no thinking required to start it.
3. **No persistence by default.** State lives in memory. Persistence is the thing the prototype is _checking_, not something it should depend on. If the question explicitly involves a database, hit a scratch DB or a local file with a clear "PROTOTYPE — wipe me" name.
4. **Skip the polish.** No tests, no error handling beyond what makes the prototype _runnable_, no abstractions. The point is to learn something fast.
5. **Surface the state.** After every action (logic) or on every variant switch (UI), print or render the full relevant state so the user can see what changed.
6. **Capture it when done.** Fold any validated decision into the real code, then keep the prototype itself as a **primary source** — copy it into the workbook at `<repo>/prototypes/<name>/` and point at it from the ticket, along with the verdict and the question it settled. **Never commit or push a prototype**: these repos are public, and a half-finished experiment on a branch reads to the rest of the team as work in progress. Delete a UI prototype out of the working tree once it's been copied across. The repo keeps only the validated decision.
